# Linear System Solvers Benchmarking

This project benchmarks the performance of three numerical methods for solving linear systems of equations:

1. **Cramer's Rule**
2. **Matrix Inversion**
3. **Gauss Jordan Elimination**

The tool generates random systems of equations, solves them using the selected method, and measures execution time and error. It visualizes the results using **Matplotlib**.

---

## Features

- Generates systems of linear equations with customizable sizes.
- Supports Cramer's Rule, Matrix Inversion, and Gauss-Jordan Elimination.
- Measures execution time and calculates error for each method.
- Plots execution times for different system sizes using Matplotlib.
- Uses multiprocessing to speed up benchmarking for large systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eclipsu/sysolinear.git
   cd sysolinear
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the benchmarking tool:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter the **maximum size** of the system you want to benchmark:

   ```
   Enter the maximum size of the system for benchmarking: 50
   ```

3. The tool will:

   - Generate random systems of equations.
   - Solve them using all three methods.
   - Display execution times and errors.
   - Plot the results using Matplotlib.
